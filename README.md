# OOP Case Studies

This repository contains 5 detailed case studies designed to help learners practice and master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Each case study provides a comprehensive problem statement, system requirements, and class relationships without implementation details, allowing students to design their own solutions.

## Case Studies Overview

### 1. E-Commerce System
A system for managing online shopping with products, customers, shopping carts, and order processing. Focuses on product hierarchies, order workflows, and payment processing.

**Key OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition

### 2. Banking System
A financial system with different account types, transactions, and banking services. Emphasizes account hierarchies, transaction processing, and financial calculations.

**Key OOP Concepts:** Abstract Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

### 3. Library Management System
A system for tracking books, library members, borrowing processes, and administrative functions. Highlights media hierarchies, borrowing workflows, and fine calculations.

**Key OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Composition

### 4. Hospital Management System
A healthcare system managing patients, medical staff, hospital resources, and billing. Focuses on staff hierarchies, patient management, and medical procedures.

**Key OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition

### 5. School Management System
An educational system handling students, faculty, courses, and administrative tasks. Emphasizes academic hierarchies, course management, and grading systems.

**Key OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition

## How to Use These Case Studies

1. Read the problem statement and system requirements carefully
2. Identify the classes and their relationships
3. Design the class hierarchies and determine inheritance relationships
4. Implement the classes with appropriate attributes and methods
5. Apply OOP principles like encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction
6. Create test cases to verify your implementation

## Learning Objectives

After completing these case studies, learners should be able to:

- Design class hierarchies for complex systems
- Apply inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in real-world contexts
- Identify and implement composition and aggregation relationships
- Work with abstract classes and interfaces
- Create comprehensive object-oriented solutions for diverse domains

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance)
- Knowledge of Python's implementation of OOP features
